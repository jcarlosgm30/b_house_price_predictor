You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Files

`boston_house_price_Predictor.ipynb`: notebook file with coding and explanation about the project. 
`housing.csv`: Dataset file obtained from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing).
